Japanese Sentence Miner

This application allows users to browse example sentences in Japanese with their desired word of choice.
For example if they input リンゴ in the editText, the application will return a list of example sentences
featuring the word from a database of sentences, such as " 私はリンゴを食べました。"

The application uses Jsoup as a library to parse Strings from HTML. A special thanks to
